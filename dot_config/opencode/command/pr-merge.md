description: Authorize PR merge after reviewer approval, with plan reconciliation
---

## Instructions

**Reviewer has approved** — proceed with merge.

**Before merging:**
Follow the plan reconciliation protocol from the pr-review skill:
1. Compare implementation against the plan phases
2. Correct any plan details that don't match reality
3. Mark completed phases as done

**Then:**
Merge the PR using the appropriate method (typically squash).
